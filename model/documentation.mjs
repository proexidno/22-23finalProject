        short_description: `Zero (0) is a special number that represents the absence or lack of quantity. It serves as the additive identity, meaning that when you add 0 to any number, the result is that same number. For example, 3 + 0 equals 3. Similarly, when you subtract 0 from a number, the number remains unchanged. For instance, 7 - 0 equals 7. Zero also has unique properties when multiplied or divided. When you multiply any number by 0, the result is always 0. For example, 5 * 0 equals 0. However, division by 0 is undefined in standard arithmetic since it leads to mathematical inconsistencies.

The equals sign (=) is used to indicate equality or equivalence between two expressions or quantities. It represents the idea that the value on the left side of the equals sign is the same as the value on the right side. Equations are formed using the equals sign to express relationships and solve for unknown variables. For example, in the equation x + 2 = 7, the equals sign shows that the sum of x and 2 is equal to 7. By solving for x, we find that x equals 5. The equals sign is fundamental in mathematics as it allows us to make statements of equivalence and establish relationships between different quantities or expressions.`,
        description: `Zero (0):

Zero is considered a neutral element in many mathematical operations. When you add 0 to a number, the result is always that same number. This property is known as the additive identity. For example, 3 + 0 equals 3, and 7 + 0 equals 7.
Zero also has the property of being the additive inverse of itself. This means that when you add a number and its additive inverse (which is its negative form), the result is 0. For instance, 5 + (-5) equals 0.
In multiplication, any number multiplied by 0 always results in 0. For example, 5 * 0 equals 0, and (-2) * 0 equals 0.
However, division by 0 is undefined in standard arithmetic because it leads to mathematical inconsistencies. Dividing a number by 0 does not yield a meaningful or well-defined result.
Equals Sign (=):

The equals sign (=) is used to indicate equality or equivalence between two expressions or quantities. It signifies that the value on the left side of the equals sign is equal to the value on the right side.
Equations are formed using the equals sign to represent mathematical relationships and solve for unknown variables. For example, in the equation 2x + 3 = 9, the equals sign shows that the expression 2x + 3 is equal to 9. By solving for x, we can determine the value of the variable.
The equals sign is symmetric, meaning that you can swap the expressions on either side of the equals sign without changing the truth of the equation. For example, 4 + 3 = 7 is equivalent to 7 = 4 + 3.
It's important to note that the equals sign is used to express equality, not identity. In other words, it signifies that the values on both sides are the same, but they may have different representations or forms.
Understanding the properties and implications of 0 and the equals sign is essential for performing mathematical operations, solving equations, and establishing mathematical relationships.`,

        short_description: "In mathematics, the plus symbol (+) represents addition, which is a fundamental arithmetic operation. Addition involves combining two or more numbers to find their sum. When using the plus symbol in numerical addition, you simply place it between the numbers being added. For example, 2 + 3 equals 5. This means that starting with the number 2, you add 3 to it, resulting in a sum of 5. Addition can also involve more than two numbers. For instance, 2 + 3 + 4 equals 9. Here, you add 2 and 3 to get 5, and then add 4 to that sum, resulting in a final answer of 9. The plus symbol is a concise and universal representation of this mathematical operation.",
        description: `Addition is a fundamental mathematical operation that combines two or more numbers to find their sum. It is denoted by the plus sign (+). Addition allows us to determine the total or the result of combining quantities. Here's an explanation of how addition works in math:

To perform addition, you start with two or more addends, which are the numbers being added together. The process involves adding the addends to find the sum, also known as the total or the result.

For example, let's consider the addition problem: 5 + 3. The addends are 5 and 3. To find the sum, you add 5 and 3 together. Starting with 5, you combine it with 3, resulting in a sum of 8.

Addition can also involve larger numbers and multiple-digit numbers. In this case, you start adding from the rightmost digits and work your way left, carrying over when necessary. For instance, let's consider the addition problem: 123 + 456. Starting from the right, you add 3 and 6, resulting in 9. Moving to the tens place, you add 2, 5, and the carry-over 1, resulting in 8. Finally, in the hundreds place, you add 1 and 4, resulting in 5. Therefore, the sum is 579.

It's important to note that addition follows specific rules and properties. For example, the order of the addends does not affect the result, unlike subtraction where the order matters. Additionally, adding zero to any number leaves the number unchanged.`,

        description: `Subtraction is a mathematical operation that involves finding the difference between two numbers. It is denoted by the minus sign (-). Subtraction allows us to determine how much one quantity decreases or differs from another. Here's an explanation of how subtraction works in math:

To perform subtraction, you start with a minuend, which is the number you are subtracting from, and a subtrahend, which is the number being subtracted. The process involves subtracting the subtrahend from the minuend to find the difference, also known as the result or the remainder.

For example, let's consider the subtraction problem: 9 - 4. The minuend is 9, and the subtrahend is 4. To find the difference, you subtract 4 from 9. Starting with 9, you take away 4, resulting in a difference of 5.

Subtraction can also involve larger numbers and multiple-digit numbers. In this case, you start subtracting from the rightmost digits and work your way left, borrowing when necessary. For instance, let's consider the subtraction problem: 357 - 148. Starting from the right, you subtract 8 from 7, which requires borrowing. So, you borrow 1 from the tens place, making the ones place 17 - 8 = 9. Moving to the tens place, you subtract 4 from 4, resulting in 0. Finally, in the hundreds place, you subtract 1 from 3, resulting in 2. Therefore, the difference is 209.

It's important to note that subtraction follows specific rules and properties. For example, the order of the numbers being subtracted affects the result, unlike addition where the order doesn't matter. Additionally, subtracting a number from itself always results in 0.`,

To divide, you determine how many times one number (the divisor) can fit into another number (the dividend) without remainder. The quotient is the result obtained from this division process. Division is the inverse operation of multiplication, and dividing by zero is undefined.`,
        description: `Division is a mathematical operation that involves distributing or partitioning a quantity into equal parts. It is denoted by the division symbol (÷) or the forward slash (/). Division allows us to determine how many times one number (the divisor) is contained in another number (the dividend) and find the resulting quotient.

To perform division, you divide the dividend by the divisor to obtain the quotient. The process involves determining how many times the divisor can be subtracted or divided into the dividend without remainder. The quotient represents the number of equal parts or groups obtained.

For example, consider the division problem: 12 ÷ 3. The dividend is 12, and the divisor is 3. Dividing 12 by 3 means finding how many groups of 3 can be formed. In this case, you can subtract 3 from 12 four times without remainder. So, the quotient is 4.

Division can also involve larger numbers and multiple-digit divisors. In such cases, long division is often used. It is a methodical process that involves dividing digit by digit and carrying out remainders, if any, to obtain the quotient.

For instance, consider the division problem: 84 ÷ 7. Starting from the leftmost digit, you divide 8 by 7, resulting in 1. Then, you multiply 1 by the divisor (7), subtract the result (7) from 8, and bring down the next digit (4). Now, you divide 14 by 7, yielding 2. The final quotient is 12.

It's important to note that division has specific rules and properties. For example, dividing a number by 0 is undefined in standard arithmetic. Division is the inverse operation of multiplication, and the order of the numbers being divided affects the result.`,

        docs: `In mathematics, the plus symbol (+) is used to represent addition, which is one of the four basic arithmetic operations. Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their sum.

        Here's how addition works using the plus symbol:
        
        1. Numerical Addition:
        When adding two numbers, you place the plus symbol (+) between them. For example:
        
        • 2 + 3 = 5
        In this case, you start with the number 2, and by adding 3 to it, you get a sum of 5.
        You can also add more than two numbers together:
        
        • 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
        Here, you add 2 and 3 to get 5, and then add 4 to that sum to obtain 9.
        2. Algebraic Addition:
        The plus symbol is also used in algebra to represent addition of variables or expressions. For example:
        
        • x + y
        In this case, x and y are variables, and the plus symbol indicates that they should be added together.
        You can combine like terms in algebraic addition. For instance:
        
        • 2x + 3x
        Here, 2x and 3x are like terms (they both have the same variable, x), so you can combine them using the plus symbol to get 5x.
        3. Commutative Property:
        One of the fundamental properties of addition is the commutative property, which states that changing the order of the numbers being added does not affect the sum. For example:
        
        • 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5
        In this case, swapping the order of the numbers still results in the same sum.
        4. Associative Property:
        Another important property of addition is the associative property, which states that changing the grouping of numbers being added does not affect the sum. For example:
        
        • (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9
        Here, you can either add 2 and 3 first, and then add 4 to the sum, or you can add 3 and 4 first, and then add 2 to that sum. In both cases, the result is 9.
        These properties and rules help establish the fundamental concepts of addition using the plus symbol in mathematics.`
